IMPORTANT: Add Your App Icons

You need to add the following icon files to the /public folder:

1. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
   - This is the standard app icon for Android
   
2. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)
   - This is the high-resolution app icon
   
3. favicon.ico (optional but recommended)
   - Browser tab icon

How to create icons:
1. Use a tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload your logo/icon (square, at least 512x512px)
3. Generate all required sizes
4. Download and place in /public folder

Recommended icon design:
- Simple, recognizable logo
- Good contrast
- Works well at small sizes
- Purple/Pink gradient to match your app theme (#8B5CF6)

Until you add real icons, the app will still be installable but may show a default icon.
